# CS1230 Final Project: Minecraft-Style Terrain Generation!

This project is based on my implementation of Projects 5 & 6 for this class, using the OpenGL Realtime pipeline

All project handouts can be found [here](https://cs1230.graphics/projects).

# Design Choices
- TO CHANGE DEFAULT SHADER VALUE, simply replace the initialization on line 54 of realtime.cpp with whatever value you need
- Implemented the inversion pixel-based filter, and the blur kernel-based filter
